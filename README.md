# Django Learning Management System (LMS) *A Formal Verification Study*

> ðŸ“š **Full Documentation Available**: Comprehensive technical analysis and implementation details can be found in `documentation.pdf`

## Abstract

This document presents a comprehensive analysis of a Learning Management System (LMS) implemented using the Django framework. The system is formally verified using the PRISM model checker to ensure critical security and functional properties. Key aspects include user authentication, course enrollment, section progression, and final examination processes. The model checking results demonstrate the system's compliance with essential safety and liveness properties.

### Deployment Diagram

Before diving into our deployment setup, let's understand what a production environment typically uses:

- **Nginx:** A high-performance web server that handles static file serving and request routing. It manages incoming HTTP requests and efficiently directs them to the appropriate application server.
- **Gunicorn:** A Python WSGI HTTP Server for UNIX, designed to serve Django applications in production environments. It manages multiple worker processes to handle concurrent requests efficiently.

## PRISM Model

### Design
#### Model

Our PRISM model represents a simple learning system where students can take courses. The model checking approach follows established methodologies for verifying concurrent systems, particularly focusing on educational platforms.

Students start by logging in (authentication) and then can join a course (enrollment). Each course has multiple sections, and to complete a section, students need to answer questions correctly. The progression is strictly sequential, enforcing educational prerequisites. Students can also create and upload their own courses, sharing their knowledge with others.

After finishing all sections, there's a final exam with multiple questions. To pass the course, students need to achieve a minimum score set by the teacher. This structured approach allows formal verification of critical system properties.

The model keeps track of:
- Whether a student is logged in
- If they're enrolled in a course
- Which section they're currently in
- How many questions they've answered correctly
- Their final exam score

We made sure students can't cheat by:
- Preventing double enrollment
- Making sure they complete each section before moving on
- Not letting them see the final exam until they're ready
- Keeping their progress safe when they log out

### States and Transitions

The model is defined as a Discrete-Time Markov Chain (DTMC) with state space $S$ where each state $s \in S$ is a tuple:

$s = ($  
$\quad auth,$  
$\quad enrolled,$  
$\quad course\text{-}created,$  
$\quad has\text{-}sections,$  
$\quad current\text{-}section,$  
$\quad correct\text{-}answers,$  
$\quad final\text{-}points,$  
$\quad answers\text{-}submitted,$  
$\quad final\text{-}exam\text{-}in\text{-}progress,$  
$\quad progress\text{-}saved,$  
$\quad previous\text{-}section$  
$)$

Where:
- $auth, enrolled, course\text{-}created, has\text{-}sections \in \{0,1\}$
- $current\text{-}section \in \{0,...,4\}$
- $correct\text{-}answers \in \{0,1,2\}$
- $final\text{-}points \in \{0,...,10\}$
- $answers\text{-}submitted, final\text{-}exam\text{-}in\text{-}progress, progress\text{-}saved \in \{0,1\}$
- $previous\text{-}section \in \{0,...,3\}$

### Properties

The system's properties are expressed in PCTL (Probabilistic Computation Tree Logic):

#### Enrollment Properties
- $P > 0 [ F (enrolled=1 \wedge previous\_section>0) ]$
- $P \leq 0 [ F (enrolled=1 \wedge auth=0) ]$
- $P \leq 0 [ F (enrolled=0 \wedge current\_section>0) ]$
- $P \leq 0 [ F (has\_sections=0 \wedge enrolled=1) ]$

#### Course Management
- $P \leq 0 [ F (course\_created=1 \wedge auth=0) ]$
- $P \leq 0 [ F (has\_sections=1 \wedge course\_created=0) ]$

#### Progress Properties
- $P \leq 0 [ F (current\_section > previous\_section + 1) ]$
- $P \leq 0 [ F (auth=0 \wedge (correct\_answers>0 \vee final\_exam\_in\_progress=1)) ]$
- $P \leq 0 [ F (current\_section>0 \wedge current\_section<MAX\_SECTIONS \wedge correct\_answers<2 \wedge progress\_saved=1) ]$

#### Exam Properties
- $P \leq 0 [ F (current\_section=FINAL\_SECTION \wedge final\_points<MIN\_POINTS\_TO\_PASS) ]$
- $P \leq 0 [ F (current\_section<MAX\_SECTIONS \wedge final\_exam\_in\_progress=1) ]$
- $P \leq 0 [ F (answers\_submitted=1 \wedge final\_exam\_in\_progress=0) ]$
- $P \leq 0 [ F (final\_exam\_in\_progress=1 \wedge answers\_submitted=0 \wedge final\_points>0) ]$

### Results

The PRISM model checker verified all specified properties successfully, as shown in Figure 5. Each property evaluated to "true", indicating that:

- All security constraints are enforced (authentication, authorization)
- Course progression logic is maintained (no section skipping, proper enrollment)
- Exam integrity is preserved (no early access, proper submission handling)
- Course management rules are followed (proper creation sequence, section requirements)

## Django

Django follows a modular design pattern where each functionality is organized into "apps". Each app serves as a distinct component of the project, handling specific functionalities of the system. The framework implements the Model-View-Template (MVT) architectural pattern, which is a variation of MVC (Model-View-Controller). In this pattern, Models define the database structure, Views handle the business logic, and Templates manage the presentation layer. This separation of concerns allows for better code organization, reusability, and maintenance. Our Learning Management System leverages this architecture to create a scalable and maintainable educational platform.

Let's break down what each app does:

- **courses**: The main application that manages:
  - Course creation and management
  - Section organization
  - Progress tracking
  - Section questions

- **users**: Handles authentication and user management:
  - User accounts
  - Authentication
  - Profile management

- **final**: Manages examination functionality:
  - Final exam creation
  - Multiple question types
  - Grading system

Each app contains standard components following Django's architectural principles:
- **models.py:** Defines database schema and relationships
- **views.py:** Handles request processing and response generation
- **forms.py:** Manages form validation and processing
- **urls.py:** Defines URL routing patterns
- **templates/:** Contains HTML templates for rendering

This modular architecture promotes code organization and maintainability, with each component having clear responsibilities within the system.
